            <p> For those of you who don't know, White Rabbit is an iconic candy in China. It's like Kitkat for Americans. Wrapped in editable rice paper, the chewy milk candy is a staple in our childhood memory. I recently spotted their new Matcha flavor in H-Mart, but didn't end up buying as I had too much grocery. Definitely on my next-to-try bucket list. If anyone has tried this, feel free to use the contact form to let me know what you think! </p>
